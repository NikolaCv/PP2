2
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,480
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

3
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

4
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,440
With all due respect...

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,640
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

6
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,560
Yes, of course.

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,640
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

8
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,680
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

9
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,760
I'm TC-14 at your service.

10
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,680
This way, please.

11
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,480
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

12
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,400
Make yourselves comfortable.

13
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,760
My master
will be with you shortly.

14
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,680
I have a bad feeling about this.

15
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,680
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

16
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,560
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

17
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,960
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

18
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

19
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,920
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

20
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,960
But not at the expense
of the moment.

21
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,880
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

22
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,840
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,440
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

24
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,600
These Federation types are cowards.

25
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,440
The negotiations will be short.

26
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,720
What? What did you say?

27
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,680
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

28
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,560
I knew it.

29
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,840
They're here to force a settlement.

30
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,080
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

31
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,720
Are you brain-dead?

32
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

33
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,520
Send a droid.

34
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,560
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

35
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,880
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

36
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

37
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,320
What is it?

38
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,000
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

39
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,240
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

41
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,440
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

42
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,000
Begin landing your troops.

43
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
My lord, is that legal?

44
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
I will make it legal.

45
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,320
And the Jedi?

46
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,840
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,640
Kill them immediately.

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,880
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

49
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,400
Captain, look!

50
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
Shields--

51
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,960
Sorry.

52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
Dioxis.

53
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,600
They must be dead by now.

54
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,280
Destroy what's left of them.

55
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,360
Oh! Excuse me.

56
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
-Roger, roger.

57
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,840
Uh-oh. Blast them.

58
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,840
What is going on down there?

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,840
We lost the transmission, sir.

60
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,040
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

61
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, no, but I don't--
Seal off the bridge.

62
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,720
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

63
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
I want droidekas
up here at once!

64
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
We will not survive this.

65
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,720
Close the blast doors!

66
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
That will hold them.

67
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,880
They are still coming through.

68
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,840
This is impossible!

69
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,880
Where are those droidekas?

70
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,080
Master! Destroyers!

71
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,560
They have shield generators!

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,560
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

73
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,960
They're no match for droidekas.

74
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,680
Sir!

75
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

76
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,400
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

77
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,640
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

78
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,680
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

79
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,280
Let's split up.

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,480
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

81
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,360
You were right
about one thing, Master.

82
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,800
The negotiations were short.

83
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,240
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

84
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,360
It's Queen Amidala herself.

85
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,800
At last we are getting results.

86
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,000
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

87
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,080
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

88
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,760
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

89
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,320
I was not aware of such failure.

90
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,040
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

91
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,760
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

92
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,040
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

93
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,440
You must be mistaken.

94
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,480
Beware, Viceroy.

95
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,200
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

96
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,200
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

97
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,720
You assume too much.

98
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,160
We will see.

99
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,560
- She's right. The senate will never--
- It's too late now.

100
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,520
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

101
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,800
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

102
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,680
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

103
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,880
How could that be true?

104
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,160
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

105
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,880
It must-- handiwork--
negotiate-- ambassadors--

106
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,520
- nobody would--
- Senator Palpatine.

107
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,440
What's happening?

108
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
Check the transmission generator.

109
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,120
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

110
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,440
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

111
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,200
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

112
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,040
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

113
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,240
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

114
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,600
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

115
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,240
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

116
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,360
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

117
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,520
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

118
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,600
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

119
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,520
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

120
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,680
and there is no trace of theJedi.

121
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,440
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

122
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,920
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

123
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,200
Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.

124
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,160
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

125
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
Get down!

126
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,240
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

127
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,800
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

128
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,880
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

129
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,560
I spake.

130
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,720
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

131
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,600
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

132
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,640
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

133
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

134
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,640
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

135
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,600
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

136
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,280
You saved my again.

137
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,200
- What's this?
- A local.

138
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,760
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

139
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,120
More?
"More'' did you spake?

140
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,920
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

141
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,120
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

142
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,480
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

143
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,320
Can you take us there?

144
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,560
On second thought, no.

145
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,080
- Not really, no.
- No?

146
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
'Tis embarrassing...

147
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,160
but my afraid
my've been banished.

148
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,240
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

149
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,280
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

150
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,280
- You hear that?
- Yah.

151
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,000
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

152
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,600
If they find us,
they will crush us...

153
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,080
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

154
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,840
Oh.

155
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,960
Yousa point is well seen.

156
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,320
Dis way. Hurry!

157
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

158
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
Ah, my warning you.

159
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,560
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

160
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,880
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

161
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,200
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

162
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,440

How wude.

169
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,160
Yousa cannot bees hair.

170
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,640
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

171
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,440
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

172
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,000
Wesa no like da Naboo.

173
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,800
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

174
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,720
Day tink day brains so big.

175
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,800
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

176
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,120
Mesa no tink so.

177
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,000
Day not know of uss-en.

178
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,920
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

179
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,280
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

180
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,000
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

181
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,560
Then speed us on our way.

182
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,080
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

183
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,880
We could use a transport.

184
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,720
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

185
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,800
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

186
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,440
'tis goen through the planet core.

187
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
Now...

188
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,200
go.

189
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,480
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

190
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,560
Master, what's a bongo?

191
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,560
A transport, I hope.

192
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Deysa setten yousa up.

193
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,280
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

194
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,400
Any help here would be hot.

195
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
Master, we're short on time.

196
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,080
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

197
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,080
This Gungan may be of help.

198
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,040
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

199
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,880
Hisen to be pune-ished.

200
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,080
I saved his life.

201
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,600
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt.''

202
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,400
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

203
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,760
Binks...

204
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,680
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

205
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,920
Begone wit him!

206
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,760
Count me outta dis one.

207
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,880
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

208
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,000
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

209
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,160
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

210
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,400
- Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

211
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,360
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

212
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,080
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

213
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

214
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,600
Yud-say boom da gasser...

215
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,400
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

216
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

217
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,600
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

218
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,600
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

219
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,600
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

220
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,960
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

221
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,600
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

222
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,560
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

223
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,000
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

224
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,920
Yes, my lord.

225
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,080
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

226
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,520
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

227
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,400
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

228
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,200
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

229
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

230
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,600
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

231
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,480
Wesa dyin' here.

232
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
-Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet''?

233
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,120
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

234
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,000
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

235
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,440
Power's back.

236
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
Monster's back!

237
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,760
Relax.

238
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,280
You overdid it.

239
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
Head for that outcropping.

240
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,280
Oh, boy.

241
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,160
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

242
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,880
Ah, victory.

243
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,880
Dis'n loverly.

244
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,040
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

245
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,160
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

246
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,320
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

247
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,760
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

248
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,840
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

249
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,960
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,640
Process them.

251
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,480
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

252
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,160
Roger, roger.

253
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,920
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

254
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
Get their weapons.

255
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,520
Yousa guys bombad!

256
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,360
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

257
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,280
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

258
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,160
The negotiations
never took place.

259
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,560
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

260
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
They've knocked out
all our communications.

261
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,000
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

262
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,720
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

263
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,240
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

264
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,280
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

265
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

266
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,080
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

267
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,680
They can't afford to kill her.

268
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

269
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,840
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

270
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,840
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

271
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,240
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

272
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,720
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

273
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,640
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

274
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,560
We are brave, Your Highness.

275
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,800
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

276
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,280
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

277
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,000
Be careful, Governor.

278
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,560
We'll need to free those pilots.

279
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,560
I'll deal with that.

280
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,880
Halt.

281
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,600
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

282
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,240
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

283
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,440
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

284
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,080
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

285
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,040
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

286
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,440
Come on. Move!

287
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,520
Go!

288
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,200
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

289
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,920
Hello, boyos.

290
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,560
There's the blockade.

291
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,120
The shield generator's been hit!

292
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,800
How wude!

293
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,920
We're losing droids fast.

294
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,240
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

295
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,520
The shields are gone.

296
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,600
The power's back!

297
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,600
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

298
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,200
Deflector shields up at maximum.

299
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,960
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

300
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,840
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

301
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,040
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

302
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,760
It's small, out of the way, poor.

303
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,560
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

304
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,480
How can you be sure?

305
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,440
It's controlled by the Hutts.

306
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,240
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

307
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,560
- If they discovered her--
- It'd be no different than landing...

308
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,480
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

309
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,600
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

310
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
which gives us the advantage.

311
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,880
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

312
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,480
She has disappeared, my lord.

313
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,600
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

314
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,520
I want that treaty signed.

315
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,600
My lord...

316
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,160
it's impossible to locate the ship.

317
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,400
It's out of our range.

318
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,680
Not for a Sith.

319
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,040
This is my apprentice...

320
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,000
Darth Maul.

321
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,440
He will find your lost ship.

322
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,800
This is getting out of hand.

323
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,880
Now there are two of them.

324
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,880
We should not
have made this bargain.

325
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,360
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

326
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,240
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

327
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,560
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

328
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,160
R2-D2, Your Highness.

329
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,640
Thank you, R2-D2.

330
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,640
Padmé.

331
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,160
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

332
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,160
It deserves our gratitude.

333
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,360
Continue, Captain.

334
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,960
Your Highness,
with your permission...

335
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,720
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

336
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,040
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

337
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,640
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

338
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,560
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

339
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,480
Hello.

340
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,440
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

341
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,920
I'm Padmé.

342
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,920
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

343
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,960
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

344
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,600
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

345
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,240
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday

348
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,040
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

349
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,040
- That's it-- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

350
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,080
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

351
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,320
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

352
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,800
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

353
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,920
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

354
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,000
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

355
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,160
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

356
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,720
Wait!

357
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,120
Wait.

358
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,160
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

359
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,880
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

360
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,000
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

361
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,160
The queen wishes it.

362
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,120
She's curious about the planet.

363
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,520
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

364
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,480
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

365
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,280
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

366
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,200
The few spaceports like this one...

367
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,520
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

368
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,480
Like us.

369
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,440
Dissen berry, berry bad.

370
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,400
Icky, icky goo!

371
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,200
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

372
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,480
Good day to you.

373
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,400
What do you want?

374
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,480
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

375
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,480
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

376
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,000
Boy, get in here now!

377
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,920
My droid has a readout of what I need.

378
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,040
What took you so long?

379
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,160
I was cleaning the fan switches.

380
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,920
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

381
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,160
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

382
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,080
We'll find what you need.

383
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,120
Don't touch anything.

384
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,800
- Are you an angel?
- What?

385
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,480
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

386
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,360
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

387
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,960
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

388
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,240
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

389
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,040
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

390
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

391
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,200
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

392
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,520
How long have you been here?

393
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,480
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

394
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,200
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

395
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,920
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

396
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,760
You're a slave?

397
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,840
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

398
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,560
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

399
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,960
- I got ya.
- Hey!

400
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,760
Hit the nose.

401
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,640
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

402
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,280
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

403
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,760
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

404
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,680
Saying of which...

405
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,080
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

406
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,160
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

407
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,040
Republic credits?

408
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,960
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

409
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,080
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

410
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,680
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

411
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,560
No, they won't!

412
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,680
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

413
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,880
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

414
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,920
No money, no parts, no deal.

415
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,400
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

416
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,080
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

417
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,480
We're leaving.Jar Jar.

418
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,440
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

419
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,320
I was glad to meet you too.

420
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,720
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

421
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,680
They seemed nice to me.

422
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,640
Clean the racks.

423
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,040
Then you can go home.

424
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,880
Yippee!

425
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,960
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

426
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,880
A few containers of supplies.

427
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,920
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

428
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,280
not in the amount
you're talking about.

429
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,200
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

430
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,640
I'll check back later.

431
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,000
Noah gain. Noah gain.

432
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,840
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

433
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,320
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

434
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,480
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

435
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,480
Are you going to pay for that?

436
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,200
It costs seven wupiupi.

437
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,560
Oops.

438
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,680
Is this yours?

439
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,480
Who, mesa--

440
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,520
Careful, Sebulba.

441
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,560
He's a big-time outlander.

442
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,080
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

443
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,920
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

444
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,960
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

445
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,360
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

446
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,440
- Hi.
- Hi there.

447
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,280
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

448
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,200
He picked a fight with a Dug...

449
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,720
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

450
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,280
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

451
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,240
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

452
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,160
Thanks, my young friend.

453
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,160
But mesa doen nutten!

454
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,800
This storm will slow them down.

455
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,360
Looks pretty bad.

456
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,040
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

457
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,880
We'll be right there.

458
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,120
Here, you'll like these pallies.

459
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,720
- Here.
- Thank you.

460
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,040
My bones are aching.

461
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,520
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

462
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,360
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

463
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,960
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

464
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,360
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

465
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,200
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

466
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,680
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

467
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,960
Mom!

468
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,640
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

469
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,040
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

470
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,560
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

471
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,960
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

472
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,960
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

473
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,480
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

474
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,840
He's wonderful.

475
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,680
You really like him?

476
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,600
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

477
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,080
Where is everybody?

478
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,320
Whoops.

479
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,520
Oh, hello.

480
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,800
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

481
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,720
How might I serve you?

482
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,520
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

483
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,040
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

484
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,800
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

485
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,000
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

486
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,000
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

487
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,040
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

488
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,640
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, " naked''?

489
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,360
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

490
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,160
The death toll is catastrophic.

491
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,560
We must bow to their wishes.

492
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,640
You must contact me.

493
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,360
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

494
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,360
Send no transmissions of any kind.

495
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,320
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

496
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,240
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

497
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,720
Either way,
we're running out of time.

498
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,840
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

499
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,640
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

500
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,560
Move against the Jedi first.

501
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,280
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

502
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,200
to sign the treaty.

503
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,400
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

504
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,840
At last we will have revenge.

505
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,720
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

506
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,120
They will be no match for you.

507
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,640
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

508
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,560
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

509
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,040
- Any attempt to escape--
- And they blow you up!

510
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,440
How wude!

511
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,880
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

512
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,800
The Republic's antislavery laws--

513
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,160
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

514
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,360
We must survive on our own.

515
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,760
Xcuse me.

516
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,200
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

517
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,040
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

518
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,760
Very fast, very dangerous.

519
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,320
I'm the only human who can do it.

520
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,320
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

521
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,720
Don't do that again.

522
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,440
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

523
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,040
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

524
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,920
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

525
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

526
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,720
I don't think so.

527
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,920
No one can kill a Jedi.

528
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,680
I wish that were so.

529
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,760
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

530
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,920
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

531
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,240
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

532
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,520
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

533
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,840
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

534
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,840
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

535
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,880
on a very important mission.

536
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,920
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

537
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,520
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

538
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,800
I can help.
I can fix anything.

539
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,360
I believe you can.

540
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,160
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

541
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,880
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

542
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,400
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

543
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,640
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

544
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,960
Podracing.

545
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,880
Greed can be a powerful ally.

546
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,760
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

547
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,080
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

548
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,080
You could enter my pod.

549
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,920
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

550
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,840
You could make him think
it was yours...

551
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,080
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

552
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,720
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

553
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,240
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

554
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,400
But, Mom, I love it.

555
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,920
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

556
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,240
Anakin.

557
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,000
Your mother's right.

558
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,080
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

559
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,120
No.

560
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,440
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

561
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,840
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

562
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,800
We'll find some other way.

563
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,520
There is no other way.

564
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,800
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

565
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,440
He was meant to help you.

566
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,240
Are you sure about this?

567
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,880
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

568
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,960
The queen will not approve.

569
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,880
The queen doesn't need to know.

570
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,520
Well, I don't approve.

571
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,120
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

572
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,800
How can you do this?

573
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,080
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

574
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,280
My ship will be the entry fee.

575
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,400
Not bad!

576
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,360
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

577
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,640
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

578
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,160
What would the boy ride?

579
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,680
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

580
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,040
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

581
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,720
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

582
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,080
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

583
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,520
That you did.

584
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,320
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

585
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,840
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

586
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,560
The fastest ever built.

587
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,600
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

588
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,880
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

589
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,320
and I supply the boy.

590
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,160
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

591
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,080
If it's going to be 50-50...

592
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,720
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

593
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,800
If we win...

594
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,560
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

595
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,760
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

596
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,480
Either way, you win.

597
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,320
Deal!

598
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,400
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

599
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,840
What if this plan fails, Master?

600
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,560
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

601
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,120
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...

602
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,480
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

603
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,480
And...

604
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,400
there's something about this boy.

605
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,200
You should be very proud of your son.

606
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,160
He gives without any thought
of reward.

607
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,040
He knows nothing of greed.

608
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,200
He has--

609
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,960
He has special powers.

610
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,840
Yes.

611
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,480
He can see things
before they happen.

612
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,280
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

613
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,200
It's a Jedi trait.

614
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,000
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

615
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,360
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

616
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,280
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

617
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,080
Who was his father?

618
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,520
There was no father.

619
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,120
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

620
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,360
I can't explain what happened.

621
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,680
Can you help him?

622
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,600
I don't know.

623
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,480
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

624
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,880
Wow, a real astro droid!

625
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,320
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

626
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,280
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

627
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,040
With this?

628
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,800
You're such a joker, Ani.

629
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,000
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

630
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,200
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

631
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,480
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

632
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,960
Keep away from
those energy binders.

633
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,400
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

634
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,840
Okay.

635
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,840
My tongue is fat.

636
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,920
My tongue-- Wrench.

637
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,640
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

638
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,360
I'm stuck.

639
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,320
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

640
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,800
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

641
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,920
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

642
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,160
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

643
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,240
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

644
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,480
My mouth.

645
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,880
Ani, I'm stuck.

646
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,960
My tongue is fat.

647
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,920
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

648
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,000
Thank you.

649
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,480
Go.

650
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,880
It's working!
It's working!

651
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,480
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

652
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,360
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

653
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,280
Most of them.

654
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,280
Has anyone been to 'em all?

655
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,080
Not likely.

656
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,280
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

657
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,720
Ani, bedtime!

658
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,480
There we are.
Good as new.

659
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,360
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

660
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,760
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

661
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,360
Go on.

662
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,360
You have a big day tomorrow.

663
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,280
Sleep well, Ani.

664
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,840
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

665
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,560
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

666
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,320
Wait a minute.

667
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,840
I need a midi-chlorian count.

668
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,200
The reading is off the chart.

669
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,120
Over 20,000.

670
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,720
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

671
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,560
No Jedi has.

672
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,640
What does that mean?

673
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,040
I'm not sure.

674
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,880
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

675
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,680
Patience, my blue friend.

676
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,960
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

677
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,800
And we'll be far away from here.

678
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,800
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

679
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,160
I warn you, no funny business.

680
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,280
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

681
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,760
I have great faith in the boy.

682
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,920
He's a credit to your race...

683
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,120
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

684
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,840
Oh, no!

685
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,600
Why do you think that?

686
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,520
He always wins!

687
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,800
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

688
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,160
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

689
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,080
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

690
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,000
the boy and his mother.

691
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,680
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

692
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,240
The boy, then.

693
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,600
We'll let fate decide, huh?

694
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,000
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

695
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,040
Blue, it's the boy.

696
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,240
Red...

697
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,160
his mother.

698
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,800
You won this small toss,
outlander...

699
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,960
but you won't win the race!

700
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,080
So it makes little difference!

701
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,200
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

702
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,200
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

703
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,640
Good morning.

704
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,320
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

705
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,160
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

706
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,520
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

707
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,680
Do what?

708
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,720
Finish the race, of course.

709
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,520
You've never won a race?

710
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,240
Well, not exactly.

711
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,280
Not even finished?

712
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,760
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

713
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,840
Of course you will.

714
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,040
That's absolutely right.

715
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,000
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

716
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,600
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

717
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,320
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

718
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,120
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

719
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,280
Sebulba!

720
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,240
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

721
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,280
Mawhonic!

722
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,400
A hearty hello...

723
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,080
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

724
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,840
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

725
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,360
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

726
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,760
And hoping for a big win today...

727
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,120
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

728
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,920
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...

729
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,280
a local boy.

730
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,040
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

731
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,920
Be safe.

732
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,280
I will, Mom. I promise.

733
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,400
You won't walk away from this one...

734
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,640
you slave scum.

735
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,880
Don't count on it, slime ball.

736
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,280
You're bantha fodder!

737
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,800
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

738
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,480
Right.

739
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,960
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

740
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,680
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

741
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,360
I will.

742
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,600
May the Force be with you.

743
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,120
Jabba the Hutt.

744
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,160
Welcome.

745
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,200
Begin the race!

746
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,360
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.

747
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,320
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

748
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,640
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not--

749
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,520
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

750
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,760
You should too.

751
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,880
You assume too much.

752
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,920
Start your engines.

753
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,800
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

754
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,240
Oh, no!

755
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,800
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

756
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,880
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

757
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,640
Come on, Ani!

758
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,320
And there goes Skywalker!

759
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,840
Go, Ani, go!

760
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

761
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,880
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...

762
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,200
on the canyon dune turn.

763
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,520
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

764
00:60:09,120 --> 00:60:11,240
Oh, no!

765
00:60:15,840 --> 00:60:17,640
Where is Master Anakin?

766
00:60:20,800 --> 00:60:22,880
Look. Here he comes.

767
00:60:25,680 --> 00:60:27,880
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

768
00:60:28,720 --> 00:60:30,080
Yay! Yippee!

769
00:60:37,280 --> 00:60:40,720
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

770
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,360
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

771
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,720
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

772
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,120
Here he comes!

773
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,240
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

774
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,760
followed closely by Skywalker!

775
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,720
Go, Ani!

776
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,880
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

777
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,000
It's Skywalker!

778
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,200
Sebulba!

779
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:58,400
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

780
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,200
Did he crash-ed?

781
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,560
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

782
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,000
He's catching Sebulba!

783
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,480
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

784
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,880
That little human being
is out of his mind!

785
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,080
They're side by side!

786
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,360
- Yippee!
- Yay!

787
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,040
I can't believe it.

788
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,000
The crowds are going nuts!

789
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,040
